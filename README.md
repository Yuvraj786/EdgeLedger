Investment banking website part of course

This is Just a sample project, In a css course I am doing, This is the 4th project.

What it has:
1. basic styling
2. Bing Maps funcionality - with custom pushpin
3. Contact form - that don't work
4. smooth scrolling effect 

Contibutions:
I guess you could add animations or other design changes.
